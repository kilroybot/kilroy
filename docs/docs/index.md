## About

**Kilroy** is a framework for training bots
to generate viral social media posts.

It uses reinforcement learning, as well as usual supervised learning,

that is more likely to see big numbers.

You can deploy your own instance of **kilroy**
using any backbone model and train it on any social media platform.
