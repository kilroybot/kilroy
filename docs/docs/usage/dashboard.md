# Dashboard

The main way to interact with the system is through the dashboard.
The dashboard is a web application
that allows you to control the training process.

It is accessible at
[`http://localhost:14000`](http://localhost:14000) by default.

## Pages

The dashboard has several pages described below.

### Home

The home page shows the current status and metadata
of all the components of the system.
It also shows the current status of the training process
and a simplified view of the metrics.
